        TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading.
        Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has
        grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual
        TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak
        for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available,
        free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall,
        Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe
        Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.

        The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British
        Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks
        are posted daily; TED Translators, which provides subtitles and
        interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers
        worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The
        Audacious Project that takes a collaborative approach to funding ideas
        with the potential to create change at thrilling scale; TEDx, which
        supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized
        TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping
        world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of
        their remarkable projects and activities.

        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local,
        self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
        experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine
        to spark deep discussions and connection. These local, self-organized
        events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.
        The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
        individual TEDx events are self-organized.{' '}

        TEDxBVCOE is an initiative that aims to ignite and magnify the wealth of knowledge of youthful minds. It incites them to unravel their true potential, explore beyond the possible. At TEDxBVCOE, we believe in exploring new ideas worth spreading because ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes. We believe that our theme - ‘Paradoxical Pendulum’ is open for multiple diverse interpretations through physics, metaphors, and romanticism, which allows our speakers to ideate freely and profusely.
